_(theme music playing)_

(cawing)

_(dog barking)_

You're wearing a black cloak again.

I've been sent to negotiate with you.

It appears my trusting nature got the better of me.

It's happened before.

I was hoping your loyalty was real when you pledged yourself to us, Jon Snow.

Truly I was.

The Halfhand ordered me to join your army and bring back whatever information I could to Castle Black.

He made me k\*ll him so you'd trust me.

I was loyal... to him and to my Night's Watch vows.

All your vows?

She wasn't enough to turn you, eh?

Were you enough to turn her?

She put three arrows in me when I escaped.

Did you see her again at Castle Black?

Yes.

And?

She's dead.

Your doing?

No.

We'll drink to her.

**Mance Rayder**: Of all the ways I'd k\*ll you, poison would be the last.

Ygritte.

Ygritte.

(coughs)

That's not wine.

No, it's a proper northern drink, Jon Snow.

You did well.

Fought hard.

k\*lled some of our strongest men.

**Mance Rayder**: One of our giants went into your tunnel and never came out again. Mag the Mighty.

**Jon Snow**: He's dead. He k\*lled my friend, Grenn.

**Mance Rayder**: He was their king. The last of a blood line that stretches back before the First Men.

**Jon Snow**: Grenn came from a farm.

Mag and Grenn.

Grenn and Mag.

Kullback, could I trouble you for something to eat?

I don't imagine our guest has eaten anything for quite some time.

So, you're here to strike a bargain?

Turn your army around and go home.

You know I know you're low on arrows, you're low on oil, you're low on men.

How many are left, 50?

I told Tormund and Orell.

We have more than 1,000 men.

I showed you everything I had.

The whole army, 100,000 strong.

And what did you do? You fired on us with everything you had.

It wasn't much.

As soon as I saw that, I sent 400 men to climb the Wall, an unmanned stretch five miles west of here.

A lot of them will die climbing, but most of them will be over by the end of the day.

_It's me being honest with you, Jon Snow, which is more than you've ever done for me._

My people have bled enough.

We're not here to conquer.

We're here to hide behind your Wall.

Just like you.

We need your tunnel.

Now we both know that winter is coming.

And if my people aren't south of the Wall when it comes in earnest, we'll all end up worse than dead.

You want to strike a bargain with me?

Here's the bargain.

You go back, you open the gates to us, and I swear to you that no one else will die.

Refuse, and we'll k\*ll every last man at Castle Black.

Ah!

Oh, that's why you're here.

I reckon you could do it before any of them could stop you.

They'd k\*ll you, of course.

They'd k\*ll you slow.

But you knew that when you came in here.

**Mance Rayder**: Are you capable of that, Jon Snow? k\*lling a man in his own tent when he's just offered you peace? Is that what the Night's Watch is?

Is that what you are?

_(horn blows)_

**Man**: _Riders coming!_

Are you attacking us?

No.

It's like you said, we don't have the men.

_(horn blowing)_

_(dogs barking)_

(men shouting)

(horse whinnies)

Hold! To me!

To me!

(men shouting)

**Mance**: Stand down! I said my people have bled enough and I meant it.

(shouting)

**Man**: _Round them up._

_Stay with the horses._

You're the King-beyond-the-Wall?

Do you know who I am?

Never had the pleasure.

This is Stannis Baratheon, the one true king of the Seven Kingdoms.

We're not in the Seven Kingdoms and you're not dressed for this weather.

It is customary to kneel when surrendering to a king.

We do not kneel.

I'll have thousands of your men in chains by nightfall, have nowhere to put them, have nothing to feed them.

I'm not here to slaughter beat dogs.

Their fate depends on their king.

All the same, we do not kneel.

Take these men away.

What's a man of the Night's Watch doing in a wildling camp?

I was sent to discuss terms with the King-beyond-the-Wall.

You're speaking to the one true king, boy.

You will address him as Your Grace.

I know he's the king.

My father died for him.

My name is Jon Snow, Your Grace.

I'm Ned Stark's son.

Your father was an honorable man.

He was, Your Grace.

What do you think he'd have done with him?

I was this man's prisoner once.

He could have tortured me.

He could have k\*lled me.

_But he spared my life._

I think my father would have taken him prisoner, listened to what he had to say.

Very well, then.

Take him.

Your Grace.

_If my father had seen the things that I've seen,_ he'd also tell you to burn the dead before nightfall.

All of them.

_(flies buzzing)_

I would suggest milk of the poppy to ease his pain, but he is completely insensate.

Bloody Martells.

The cause appears to be manticore venom.

It is. The Death's Head manticore.

Yes, I've read a great deal about it.

It's a horrible poison.

Usually Mantari in origin.

Oh! Yes, yes.

There's nothing to be done.

Yes, there is.

May I ask what you think you're doing?

Saving him.

Your Grace, I wish it were otherwise, but Ser Gregor is beyond saving.

Well, well beyond.

This man is not even a maester, let alone Grand Maester.

That's for the best.

No maester knows how to save him.

That is exactly the sort of arrogance that had him expelled from the Citadel, Your Grace.

His curiosity was deemed dangerous and unnatural.

Rightly so, in my opinion.

You're dismissed, Grand Maester.

But, Your Grace, this is my laboratory.

Not anymore.

**Pycelle**: _But I--_

(scoffs)

_(door opens)_

You can save him?

Difficult to say, Your Grace.

_But if my past work is any guide..._

_(door slams)_

...we stand a chance.

Do everything you can.

Come to me for anything you need.

Thank you, Your Grace.

_You should know,_ the process may change him... somewhat.

Will it weaken him?

Oh, no.

Very well, then.

**Tywin**: _Not another word._

We've been over this.

The matter's closed.

I'm opening it again.

You were betrothed to Loras Tyrell.

You're still betrothed to Loras Tyrell.

And you will marry Loras Tyrell as soon as Tommen marries Margaery.

I will not.

Jaime cannot marry or inherit lands.

Tyrion's sentence will be carried out tomorrow.

You have on several occasions made great claims about your commitment to this family's future.

Your role in that future is more vital now than it ever was.

I don't care.

I will stay in King's Landing where I belong with my son the king.

When you were nine years old, I was called to the capital.

I decided to take your brother with me and not you.

You insisted that you would not be left at Casterly Rock under any circumstances.

And if you recall--

**Cersei Lannister**: I'm not interested in hearing another one of your smug stories about the time you won. This isn't going to be one of those times.

Do you think you'll be the first person dragged into a sept to be married against her will?

When you marched into the throne room to tell me we'd won the Battle of Blackwater-- do you remember?

I was sitting on the Iron Throne with Tommen.

I was about to give him essence of nightshade.

That's how far I was willing to go when I thought someone awful had come to take my son away.

Someone awful is coming to take him away.

No.

Joffrey is dead.

Myrcella's been sold like livestock.

And now you want to ship me off to Highgarden and steal my boy.

My last boy.

**Cersei Lannister**: Margaery will dig her claws in, you will dig your claws in and you'll fight over him like beasts until you rip him apart. I will burn our house to the ground before I let that happen!

And how will you do that?

I'll tell everyone the truth.

_What truth would that be?_

You don't know, do you?

You never believed it.

How is that possible?

What am I saying?

Of course it's possible.

How can someone so consumed by the idea of his family have any conception what his actual family was doing?

We were right there in front of you and you didn't see us.

One look in the past 20 years, one real look at your own children and you would have known.

Known what?

Everything they say is true.

About Jaime and me.

No.

Your legacy is a lie.

No, no, no, no.

I don't believe you.

Yes, you do.

Jaime.

**Jamie Lannitser**: You won. One fewer brother. You must be proud of yourself. There’s really nothing you wouldn't do, is there?

**Cersei Lannister**: For my family, no, nothing. I would do things for my family you couldn't imagine.

Tyrion is your family.

He's not.

You don't get to choose.

I do. So do you.

You can choose the creature that k\*lled our mother to come into this world--

Are you really mad enough to blame him for that?

_He didn't decide to k\*ll her._

_He was an infant._

A disease doesn't decide to k\*ll you.

All the same, you cut it out before it does.

What do you decide?

What do you choose?

The things I did to get back to you, to endure all that, only to find you--

I choose you.

Those are words.

Yes.

Like the ones I just said to Father.

I told him.

Told him what?

I told him about us.

You told him?

I told him I won't marry Loras Tyrell.

I told him I'm staying right here with Tommen, with you.

You think he'll just accept that?

Go and ask him.

What did you say?

I don't want to talk about Tywin Lannister.

**Cersei**: I don't choose Tywin Lannister. I don't love Tywin Lannister. I love my brother.

I love my lover.

People will whisper, they'll make their jokes.

Let them.

They're all so small, I can't even see them.

I only see what matters.

Someone will walk in.

I don't care.

I can speak the common tongue if you wish.

You speak it very well.

Before you freed me, I belonged to Master Mighdal.

I was tutor to his children.

_I taught them languages and history._

They know a great deal about your family because of me.

_Little Calla is only seven,_ but she admires you very much.

I hope I can prove worthy of her admiration.

What can I do for you?

When you took the city, the children begged me not to leave the house.

But Master Mighdal and I agreed that I must.

So I lost my home.

Now I live on the streets.

I have outfitted mess halls to feed all former slaves and barracks to shelter them.

I do not mean to offend, Your Grace.

_I went to one of these places._

The young prey on the old.

Take what they want and beat us if we resist.

My Unsullied will make them safe again in short order, my friend, this I promise you.

Even if they are safe, who would I be there?

What purpose would I serve?

_With my master, I was a teacher._

I had the respect and love of his children.

What is it that you want from me?

Your Grace, I ask you to let me sell myself back to Master Mighdal.

You want to return to a man who owned you like a goat or a chair?

Please, Your Grace.

**Fennesz**: The young may rejoice in the new world you have built for them, but for those of us too old to change, there is only fear and squalor.

I am not alone.

There are many outside waiting to beg the same of you.

I did not take this city to preside over the injustice I fought to destroy.

I took it to bring people freedom.

But freedom means making your own choices.

I will allow you to sign a contract with your former master.

It may not cover a period lasting longer than a year.

Thank you, Your Grace.

Thank you.

The masters will take advantage of this situation.

The men serving them will be slaves in all but name.

Approach, my friend.

(sobbing)

(speaking low Valyrian)

**Missandei**: _I have brought you--_

He came from the sky.

_The black one._

The winged shadow.

_He came from the sky and..._

_My girl._

My little girl.

(sobbing)

**Daenerys**: _What was her name?_

**Missandei**: _Zala, Your Grace._

How old was she?

Three.

Three.

(screeching)

(roaring)

(screeching)

(screeching)

(screeching)

**Maester Aemon**: _They came to us from White Harbor and Barrowton,_ from Fairmarket and King's Landing, from north and south, from east and west. They died protecting men, women, and children who will never know their names. _It is for us to remember them. Our brothers, we shall never see their like again._

**All**: And now their watch is ended.

**Maester Aemon**: And now their watch is ended.

Your old blind man patched me up.

_Why?_

He's sworn to treat all wounded men, friend or foe.

You want me alive so you can t\*rture me?

No one's gonna t\*rture you.

So how do we die?

Hanging? Beheading?

_Drop us from the top of the Wall?_

I don't know what happens to the prisoners.

Who decides?

I suppose Stannis does.

He your king now?

I don't have a king.

**Tormund Giantsbane**: You spent too much time with us, Jon Snow. You can never be a kneeler again.

We're gonna burn the bodies of your dead.

Do you want to say any words over them?

Words?

What kind of words?

Funeral words. I don't know how the free folk do it.

_Do what?_

Say farewell.

The dead can't hear us, boy.

Snow.

Did you love her?

She loved you.

She told you?

_No._

All she ever talked about was k\*lling you.

_That's how I know._

She belongs in the North.

_The real North._

You understand me?

_(wind howling)_

(groaning)

We can stop.

We can rest.

We'll rest with the three-eyed raven.

We're not going to make it.

We're already here.

**Bran**: _Jojen._

_Jojen._

Look, Jojen.

Look.

(groaning)

Jojen!

Come on!

Help them!

**Meera**: _Hold on to me!_

Hang on!

Hodor.

Help them!

Hodor.

(growling)

Hodor!

(screeching)

(grunts)

Hodor!

(growling)

Hodor.

(whimpering)

Hodor!

**Jojen**: _Bran!_

Save yourself, now!

(grunting)

(shouts)

**Girl**: _Come with me, Brandon Stark._

(gasping)

He is lost.

Come with me or die with him.

Go with them.

_(ice bursting)_

_(slices)_

(growling)

_They cannot follow us._

The power that moves them is powerless here.

Who are you?

The First Men called us the children, but we were born long before them.

Come, he waits for you.

_(crow caws)_

(caws)

You're the three-eyed raven?

I've been many things.

Now I am what you see.

My brother, he led us to you and now he--

He knew what would happen.

From the moment he left, he knew and he went anyway.

How do you know?

I've been watching you.

All of you.

All of your lives.

With 1,000 eyes and one.

_Now you've come to me at last,_ Brandon Stark.

Though the hour is late.

I didn't want anyone to die for me.

He died so you could find what you have lost.

You're going to help me walk again?

**Three-eyed raven**: _You will never walk again._ But you will fly.

_(bird squawks)_

Podrick.

Podrick.

Where are the horses?

I hobbled them last night.

What sort of hobble?

A figure eight like you taught me.

If you did it like I taught you, then the horses would be here.

Thieves, maybe?

It's at least 30 miles to the Eyrie from here.

You're carrying the saddlebags.

_(grunting)_

People coming.

You can sh\*t later.

There's people coming.

Morning.

Morning.

I like your sword.

_Are we getting close to the Bloody Gate?_

About 10 more miles.

Did you hear that, Podrick?

Only 10 more miles to the Bloody Gate.

Are you a knight?

No.

But you know how to use that sword?

I do.

Does it have a name?

Oathkeeper.

Mine's Needle.

Good name.

Who taught you how to fight?

My father.

Mine never wanted to.

Said fighting was for boys.

Mine said the same.

But I kept fighting the boys anyway.

_Kept losing._

Finally my father said, "If you're going to do it, you might as well do it right."

Seven blessings.

I'm Brienne of Tarth.

This is Podrick Payne.

You want something?

That's Sandor Clegane.

The Hound.

You're Arya Stark.

I asked if you wanted something.

I swore to your mother I would bring you home to her.

My mother's dead.

_I know._

I wish I could have been there to protect her.

You're not a northerner.

No, but I swore a sacred vow to protect her.

Why didn't you?

She commanded me to bring Jaime Lannister back to King's Landing.

You're paid by the Lannisters.

_You're here for the bounty on me._

I'm not paid by the Lannisters.

No?

**Sandor Clegane**: Fancy sword you've got there. Where'd you get it? I've been looking at Lannister gold all my life.

Go on, Brienne of f\*cking Tarth.

Tell me that's not Lannister gold.

Jaime Lannister gave me this sword.

The Bloody Gate is 10 miles.

I swore to your mother by the old gods--

I don't care what you swore.

Arya!

**Hound**: _You heard the girl._

She's not coming with you.

She is.

You're not a good listener.

That Valyrian steel?

I always wanted some Valyrian steel.

Come with me, Arya.

I'll take you to safety.

Safety?

Where the f\*ck's that?

**The Hound**: Her aunt in the Eyrie’s dead. Her mother’s dead. Her father’s dead. Her brother’s dead. Winterfell is a pile of rubble. There’s no safety, you dumb b\*tch. If you don’t know that by now, you’re the wrong one to watch over her.

And that's what you're doing?

Watching over her?

Aye, that's what I'm doing.

(grunts)

(panting)

(grunts)

I have no wish to k\*ll you, Ser.

I'm not a knight.

(grunts)

(groans)

(screams)

(screaming)

(groans)

(shouting)

Arya!

Arya!

Arya!

Where is she?

**Podrick**: _She was just here._

Why weren't you watching her?

I was watching you. I thought you might need some help.

Which way, Pod?

Which way did she go?

I think that way.

**Brienne**: _Arya!_

_Arya!_

(panting)

You still here?

(coughs)

Big b\*tch saved you.

I don't need saving.

No, not you.

You're a real k\*ller.

With your water dancing and your Needle.

You gonna die?

Unless there's a maester hiding behind that rock, aye, I'm done.

**The Hound**: I'd skin you alive for wine.

f\*ck water.

k\*lled by a woman.

(chuckles)

I bet you like that.

Go on, go after her.

_She'll help you._

**The Hound**: Going it alone, _you won't last a day out there._

**Arya Stark**: I'll last longer than you.

You remember where the heart is?

f\*ck it.

I'm ready.

Go on, girl.

Another name off your list.

You kept promising me.

I cut down your butcher's boy.

The ginger.

He was begging for mercy.

"Please, Ser. Please don't k\*ll me. Please, please."

_Bled all over my horse._

_Saddle stunk of butcher's boy for weeks._

And your sister.

Your pretty sister.

_I should have taken her._

That night the Blackwater burned.

I should have f\*cked her bloody.

_At least I'd have one happy memory._

Do I have to beg you?

Do it. Do it. Do it.

k\*ll me. k\*ll me! k\*ll me! k\*ll me!

_(door opens)_

_(door closes)_

_(footsteps)_

**Tyrion Lannister**: Oh get on with it, you son of a whore!

**Jaime Lannister**: Is that any way to speak about our mother?

What are you doing?

What do you think I'm doing?

A galley's waiting in the bay bound for the Free Cities.

Who's helping you?

Varys.

Varys?

You have more friends than you thought.

There's a locked door at the top of the stairs. Knock on it twice, then twice again. Varys will open.

I suppose this is good-bye, then.

Farewell, little brother.

Jaime.

Thank you for my life.

Quickly now.

_(after being released from jail by Jaime, Tyrion sneaks into his father's chambers. He finds Shae in Tywin's bed, wearing the golden chain he gave her once)_

**Shae**: _(mumbles)_ Tywin? My lion.

_(Shae raises her head. As her vision becomes clear, she sees Tyrion, looking hurt and betrayed. She grabs a knife. Tyrion charges at her. They fight, and Tyrion forces her to drop the knife. They continue to struggle violently. Tyrion grabs the chain around her neck and strangles her with it until she is dead. He sinks to the floor and sits next to Shae's lifeless body, weeping)_

**Tyrion Lannister**: I'm sorry... I'm sorry.

_(After k\*lling Shae, Tyrion stares at the wall across the room and sees several weapons on display, among them a crossbow, and his expression quickly darkens. He takes the crossbow, then heads down the hall to the privy, opening the door to find his father seated upon the toilet. Tywin seems surprised to see Tyrion, but quickly regains his composure.)_

**Tywin Lannister**: _(dryly)_ Tyrion. Put down the crossbow.

_(Tyrion does not comply)_

**Tywin Lannister**: Who released you? Your brother, I expect. He always had a soft spot for you. Come, we'll go and talk in my chambers.

_(Tywin starts to stand, but Tyrion steadies the crossbow, stopping Tywin dead in his tracks)_

**Tywin Lannister**: This is how you want to speak to me, hmm? Shaming your father has always given you pleasure.

**Tyrion Lannister**: All my life you've wanted me dead.

**Tywin Lannister**: _(nods)_ Yes. But you refused to die. I respect that. Even admire it. You fight for what's yours. I'd never let them execute you. Is that what you fear? I'll never let Ilyn Payne take your head. You're a Lannister. You're my son.

_(Tyrion does not believe his father)_

**Tyrion Lannister**: _(quietly)_ I loved her.

**Tywin Lannister**: Who?

**Tyrion Lannister**: Shae.

**Tywin Lannister**: _(sneers)_ Oh, Tyrion. Put down that crossbow.

**Tyrion Lannister**: I m\*rder\*d her. With my own hands.

**Tywin Lannister**: _(shakes his head)_ It doesn't matter.

**Tyrion Lannister**: Doesn't matter?

**Tywin Lannister**: She was a whore.

**Tyrion Lannister**: _(raises the crossbow angrily)_ Say that word again...

**Tywin Lannister**: And what? You'll k\*ll your own father in the privy? No. You're my son. Now, enough of this nonsense.

**Tyrion Lannister**: I am your son and you sentenced me to die. You knew I didn't poison Joffrey, but you sentenced me all the same. Why?

**Tywin Lannister**: Enough. We'll go back to my chambers and speak with some dignity.

**Tyrion Lannister**: I can't go back there. She's in there.

**Tywin Lannister**: You're afraid of a dead whore?

_(the moment Tywin says the word "whore" again despite being warned not to, Tyrion sh\*\*t, hitting Tywin in the belly and knocking him backwards)_

**Tywin Lannister**: _(painfully)_ You shot me. Ohh... you're no son of mine.

**Tyrion Lannister**: I am your son. I have always been your son.

_(Tyrion sh\*\*t again, k\*lling his father. Tyrion discards the crossbow as he leaves. The door opens, Varys stands there. He is shocked to see Tywin dead.)_

**Lord Varys**: What have you done?

_(Tyrion does not answer)_

**Lord Varys**: Quickly.

_(Varys pulls Tyrion, bolting the door behind them. He leads Tyrion to a room where is a large crate)_

**Lord Varys**: Trust me, my friend. I brought you this far.

_(Varys helps Tyrion to enter the crate, then shuts it. Moments later, the crate is stowed aboard a ship. Varys begins walking back towards the Red Keep, but stops when he hears the bells tolling, signaling that Tywin's body has been discovered. Realizing that returning to the castle is unsafe, Varys turns around and heads back for the ship, sitting next to Tyrion's crate in silence as the ship sails for Essos)_

**Arya Stark**: I want to see the captain.

**Ternesio Terys**: You're seeing him.

**Arya Stark**: I want to go north, to the wall.

**Ternesio Terys**: No you don't.

**Arya Stark**: I can pay.

**Ternesio Terys**: There is nothing in the north but ice and w\*r and pirates.

**Arya Stark**: I wouldn't need a cabin. Please, I could work, scrubbing the floors, or...

**Ternesio Terys**: I'm not going north, child, we're going home.

**Arya Stark**: Where's home?

**Ternesio Terys**: The Free City of Braavos.

**Arya Stark**: Wait, I have something else.

**Ternesio Terys**: More silver won't make a difference.

**Arya Stark**: _(Arya shows the coin that Jaqen H'ghar gave her)_ It's not silver, it's iron.

**Ternesio Terys**: How did you...

**Arya Stark**: Valar morghulis.

**Ternesio Terys**: Valar dohaeris. Of course, you shall have a cabin.

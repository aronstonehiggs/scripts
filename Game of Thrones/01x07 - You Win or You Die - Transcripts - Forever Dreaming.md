Previously~

He's att\*cked one of my brothers and abducted the other.

Tell your wife to return that little sh\*t of an Imp to King's Landing.

What about Jaime Lannister?

I'm half a kingdom in debt to his bloody father.

We'll talk when I return from the hunt.

The hunt?

_You'll have to sit on_ _the throne while I'm away._

You are accused of hiring a man to slay my son Bran in his bed.

I demand a trial by combat.

You have that right.

Do I have a volunteer?

I'll stand for the dwarf.

Grand Maester Pycelle. Send a raven to Casterly Rock.

Inform Tywin Lannister that he has been summoned to court _to answer for the crimes_ _of Gregor Clegane_ or be branded an enemy of the Crown

_and a traitor to the realm._

Fight!

I'm sending you both back to Winterfell.

What? I'm supposed to marry Prince Joffrey.

_He'll be the greatest king_ _that ever was, a golden lion._

And I'll give him sons with beautiful blond hair.

"Lord Orys Baratheon, black of hair."

"Axel Baratheon, black of hair."

"Robert Baratheon, black of hair."

"Joffrey Baratheon, golden-haired."

I want what I came for. I want the crown he promised me.

No, Dany, please!

A crown for a king.

Fire cannot k\*ll a dragon.

? Game of Thrones 1x07 ? You Win or You Die Original Air Date on May 29, 2011

"Summoned to court to answer for the crimes of your bannerman Gregor Clegane, the Mountain"...

Uh, "arrive within the fortnight or be branded an enemy of the Crown."

Poor Ned Stark...

Brave man, terrible judgment.

Attacking him was stupid.

Lannisters don't act like fools.

Are you gonna say something clever?

Go on, say something clever.

Catelyn Stark took my brother.

Why is he still alive?

Tyrion?

Ned Stark.

One of our men interfered, _speared him through the leg_ _before I could finish him._

Why is he still alive?

It wouldn't have been clean.

Clean.

You spend too much time worrying about what other people think of you.

I could care less what anyone thinks of me.

_That's_ what you want people to think of you.

It's the truth.

When you hear them whispering

"Kingslayer" behind your back ... _doesn't it bother you?_

Of course it bothers me.

The lion doesn't concern himself with the opinions of the sheep.

I suppose I should be grateful that your vanity got in the way of your recklessness.

I'm giving you half of our forces ...

30,000 men.

You will bring them to Catelyn Stark's girlhood home and remind her that Lannisters pay their debts.

I didn't realize you placed such a high value on my brother's life.

He's a Lannister.

He might be the lowest of the Lannisters, but he's one of us.

And every day that he remains a prisoner, the less our name commands respect.

So the lion does concern himself with the opinions of ...

No, it's not an opinion. It's a fact.

If another House can seize one of our own and hold him c\*ptive with impunity, we are no longer a House to be feared.

Your mother's dead.

Before long I'll be dead.

And you and your brother and your sister and all of her children. All of us dead; all of us rotting in the ground.

It's the family name that lives on.

It's all that lives on.

Not your personal glory, not your honor, but family.

Do you understand?

Hmm.

You're blessed with abilities that few men possess.

You are blessed to belong to the most powerful family in the kingdoms.

And you are still blessed with youth.

_And what have you done_ _with these blessings, huh?_

You've served as a glorified bodyguard for two kings ... _one a madman,_

_the other a drunk._

The future of our family will be determined in these next few months.

We could establish a dynasty that will last a thousand years.

Or we could collapse into nothing, as the Targaryens did.

I need you to become the man you were always meant to be.

Not next year. Not tomorrow.

Now.

You're in pain.

I've had worse, My Lady.

Perhaps it's time to go home.

The South doesn't seem to agree with you.

I know the truth Jon Arryn died for.

Do you, Lord Stark?

Is that why you called me here, to pose me riddles?

Has he done this before?

Jaime would have k\*lled him.

My brother is worth a thousand of your friend.

Your brother...

Or your lover?

The Targaryens wed brothers and sisters for 300 years to keep bloodlines pure.

Jaime and I are more than brother and sister.

We shared a womb.

We came into this world together. We belong together.

My son saw you with him.

Do you love your children?

With all my heart.

No more than I love mine.

And they are all Jaime's.

Thank the Gods.

In the rare event that Robert leaves his whores for long enough to stumble drunk into my bed, I finish him off in other ways.

In the morning, he doesn't remember.

You've always hated him.

Hated him? I worshipped him.

Every girl in the Seven Kingdoms dreamed of him, but he was mine by oath.

And when I finally saw him on our wedding day in the Sept of Baelor, lean and fierce and black-bearded, it was the happiest moment of my life.

Then that night he crawled on top of me, stinking of wine and did what he did ... what little he could do ... and whispered in my ear, "Lyanna."

Your sister was a corpse and I was a living girl and he loved her more than me.

When the King returns from his hunt, I'll tell him the truth.

You must be gone by then ... you and your children.

I will not have their blood on my hands.

Go as far away as you can, with as many men as you can.

Because wherever you go, Robert's wrath will follow you.

And what of my wrath, Lord Stark?

You should have taken the realm for yourself.

Jaime told me about the day King's Landing fell.

He was sitting in the Iron Throne and you made him give it up.

All you needed to do was climb the steps yourself.

Such a sad mistake.

I've made many mistakes in my life, but that wasn't one of them.

Oh, but it was.

When you play the Game of Thrones, you win or you die.

There is no middle ground.

Come here.

Oh yes, oh.

_Oh yes yes yes._

No no no no!

Is that what they teach you up in the North?

And you ... wherever you're from, do you have any idea how ridiculous you sound?

Either of you understand a thing that I'm saying?

Yes, My Lord.

Let's start over, shall we?

You be the man and you be the woman.

Well, go ahead.

_Slowly._

You're not fooling _them._ They just paid you.

They know what you are.

They know it's all just an act.

Your job is to make them forget what they know.

That takes time.

You need to...

Ease into it.

Go ahead.

_Ease into it._

He's winning you over in spite of yourself.

You're starting to like this.

He wants to believe you.

He's enjoyed his c\*ck since he was old enough to play with it.

Why shouldn't you? He knows he's better than other men.

He's always known it deep down inside. Now he has proof.

He's so good, he's reaching something deep inside of you that no one even knew was there, overcoming your very nature.

Why don't you join us, My Lord?

I'm saving myself for another.

What she doesn't know won't hurt her.

A stupid saying.

What we don't know is usually what gets us k\*lled.

She must be very beautiful.

No, not really. Impeccable bloodlines though.

I do believe My Lord's in love.

For many years. Most of my life really.

Play with her a\*s.

_And she loved me too._

I was her little confidant, her plaything.

She could tell me anything, anything at all.

She told me about all the horses that she liked, the castle she wanted to live in and the man that she wanted to marry.

A northerner with a jaw like an anvil.

_So I challenged him_ _to a duel._

_I mean, why not?_

_I'd read all the stories._

The little hero always beats the big villain in all the stories.

In the end, she wouldn't even let him k\*ll me.

"He's just a boy," she said.

_"Please don't hurt him."_

So he gave me a nice little scar to remember him by and off they went.

Is she still married to him?

Oh no.

He got himself k\*lled before the wedding...

..And she ended up with his brother, an even more impressive specimen.

She loves him, I'm afraid.

_And why wouldn't she?_

_I mean, who could compare to him?_

He's just so...

Good.

Do you know what I learned, losing that duel?

I learned that I'll never win, not that way. That's _their_ game, _their_ rules.

I'm not going to fight them.

_I'm going to f\*ck them._

_That's what I know._

That's what I am.

And only by admitting what we are can we get what we want.

And what do you want?

Oh, everything, my dear.

Everything there is.

Now wash yourselves. Both of you are working tonight.

Hmm.

You're a very lucky girl. Do you know that?

_Where I come from, we don't_ _show mercy to criminals._

Where I come from, if someone like you att\*cked a little lord?

At low tide we'd lay you on your back on the beach, your hands and feet chained to four stakes.

_The sea would come in_ _closer and closer._

You'd see death creeping toward you a few inches at a time.

Where is it you come from?

_The Iron Islands._

They far away?

You've never heard of the Iron Islands?

Trust me, you've never heard where I'm from neither.

"Trust me, _My Lord."_

You're not living in the wilderness anymore.

_In civilized lands,_ _you refer to your betters_ _by their proper titles._

And what's that?

Lord.

Why?

Why?

What do you mean why?

My father is Balon Greyjoy, Lord of the Iron Islands.

What's that got to do with you?

_If your father's lord,_ how can you be lord too?

I _will_ be lord after my father ... so you're not lord now?

No, you ...

You having a go at me? Is that it?

I just don't understand how you Southerners do things.

I'm not a Southerner.

You're from South of the wall.

That makes you a Southerner to me.

You're an impudent little wench, aren't you?

Couldn't say, My Lord.

Don't know what "impunent" means.

Impudent. It means rude, _disrespectful._

Do you want to lose that chain?

Theon Greyjoy!

The lady is our guest.

I thought she was our prisoner.

Are the two mutually exclusive in your experience?

Chances are I won't be nearby the next time that happens.

I'm used to worse than him.

I'm used to men who could chew that boy up and pick their teeth with his bones.

Why did you come here?

Didn't mean to come here.

Meant to get much further South than this.

As far South as South goes, before the long night comes.

Why? What are you afraid of?

There's things that sleep in the day and hunt at night.

Owls and Shadowcats and ...

I'm not talking about Owls and Shadowcats.

The "things" you speak of ... they've been gone for thousands of years.

They wasn't gone, old man.

They was sleeping.

And they ain't sleeping no more.

_I miss girls._

Not even talking to them. I never talked to them.

Just looking at them,

_hearing them giggle._

Don't you miss girls?

Riders.

The horn. We have to blow the horn.

Why is he alone?

_One blast_ _for a Ranger returning,_ _two for Wildlings,_ _three for ..._ there's no rider.

__Whoa, boy, whoa.__

_That's my Uncle Benjen's horse._

_Where's my Uncle?_

_Ned!_

_It's Robert. We were hunting ... a boar ..._

_I should have spent more time with you, shown you how to be a man._

_I was never meant to be a father._

_Go on._

_You don't want to see this._

_My fault._

_Too much wine, missed my thrust._

_It stinks._

_It stinks like death._

_Don't think I can't smell it._

_I paid the bastard back, Ned._

_I drove my knife right through his brain._

__You ask them if I didn't.__

__Ask them!__

_I want the funeral feast to be the biggest the Kingdoms ever saw._

_And I want everyone to taste the boar that got me._

_Now leave us, the lot of you. I need to talk to Ned._

_Robert, my sweet ..._

_Out, all of you!_

_You damned fool._

_Paper and ink on the table, write down what I say._

_"In the name of Robert of the House Baratheon, first of ... " you know how it goes._

_Fill in the damn titles._

_"I hereby command Eddard of House Stark ... " titles, titles ..._

_"to serve as Lord Regent and Protector of the Realm upon my death, to rule in my stead until my son Joffrey comes of age."_

_Give it over._

_Give it to the council after I'm dead._

_At least they'll say I did this right, _this one thing.__

_You'll rule now._

_You'll hate it worse than I did, but you'll do it well._

_The girl ..._

_Daenerys._

_You were right. Varys, Littlefinger, my brother... Worthless._

_No one to tell me "no" but you._

_Only you._

_Let her live._

_Stop it, if it's not too late._

_I will._

_And my son..._

_Help him, Ned._

_Make him better than me._

_I'll..._

_I'll do everything I can to honor your memory._

_My memory._

_King Robert Baratheon, m\*rder\*d by a pig._

_Give me something for the pain and let me die._

_Give him milk of the poppy._

_He was reeling from the wine._

_He commanded us to step aside, but..._

_I failed him._

_No man could have protected him from himself._

_I wonder, Ser Barristan, who gave the king this wine?_

_His squire, from the king's own skin._

_His squire? The Lannister boy?_

_Such a dutiful boy to make sure his Grace did not lack refreshment._

_I do hope the poor lad does not blame himself._

_His Grace has had a change of heart concerning Daenerys Targaryen._

_Whatever arrangements you made, unmake them. At once._

_I'm afraid those birds have flown._

_The girl is likely dead already._

_...Throne._

_Throne._

_Can't you help me make him understand?_

_The Dothraki do things in their own time, for their own reasons._

_Have patience, Khaleesi. We will go home, I promise you._

_My brother was a fool, I know, but he was the rightful heir to the Seven Kingdoms._

_Have I said something funny, Ser?_

_Forgive me, Khaleesi, but your ancestor Aegon the Conqueror didn't seize six of the kingdoms because they were his right._

_He had no right to them. He seized them because he could._

_And because he had dragons._

_Ah well, having a few dragons makes things easier._

_You don't believe it._

_Have you ever seen a dragon, Khaleesi?_

_I believe what my eyes and ears report._

_As for the rest... It was 300 years ago._

_Who knows what really happened?_

_Now if you'll pardon me, I'll seek out the merchant Captain, see if he has any letters for me._

_I'll come with you._

_No no, don't trouble yourself._

_Enjoy the market. I'll rejoin you soon enough._

Psst, Jorah the Andal.

The spider sends his greetings and his congratulations.

A royal pardon ... you can go home now.

Virzetha gizikhven! Mra qora! Mra qora!

My son already has his name, but I'll try your summerwine.

Just a taste.

My Lady, you are from Westeros.

You have the honor of addressing Daenerys of the House Targaryen, Khaleesi of the riding men and princess of the Seven Kingdoms.

Princess.

_Rise._

I'd still like to taste that wine.

That? Dornish swill.

_Not worthy_ _of a princess._

I have a dry red from the Arbor ... nectar of the Gods.

Let me give you a cask. Uh ... a gift.

You honor me, Ser.

The honor ... the honor is all mine.

Huh-uh, huh-uh.

There are many in your homeland that pray for your return, princess.

I hope to repay your kindness someday.

Rakharo.

Huh.

Is something wrong?

I have a thirst.

Open it.

The wine is for the Khaleesi. It's not for the likes of you.

Open it.

Pour.

It would be a crime to drink a wine this rich without at least giving it time to breathe.

Do as he says.

As the princess commands.

_Sweet, isn't it?_

_Can you smell_ _the fruit, Ser?_

Taste it, My Lord.

Tell me that that is not the finest wine _that has ever touched_ _your tongue._

You first.

Me?

I'm afraid I am not worthy of the vintage.

Besides, it is a poor wine merchant who would drink up his own wares.

You will drink.

Khaleesi!

Stop him!

Come.

You came to us as outlaws, poachers, rapers, K\*llers, thieves.

_You came alone,_ _in chains,_ _without friends_ _nor honor._

_You came to us rich_ _and you came to us poor._

Some of you bear the names of proud houses, others only bastard names or no names at all.

It does not matter.

All that is in the past.

Here, on the wall, are all one house.

_Tonight..._

You're allowed to look happy.

You're going to be a Ranger.

Isn't that what you always wanted?

I want to find my Uncle.

I know he's alive out there.

I know he is.

I wish I could help you, but I'm no Ranger.

It's the steward's life for me.

There's honor in being a steward.

Not much, really.

But there's food.

Here you begin anew.

A man of The Night's Watch...

Lives his life for the realm.

Not for a king, or a lord, or the honor of this house

_or that house;_ not for gold nor glory nor a woman's love; but for the realm _and all the people in it._

You've all learned the words of the vow.

Think carefully before you say them.

_The penalty for desertion_ is death.

You can take your vows here tonight at sunset.

Do any of you still keep the old Gods?

I do, My Lord.

You'll want to take your vow before a heart tree as your Uncle did.

Yes, My Lord.

You'll find a Weirwood a mile North of the Wall.

And your old Gods too, maybe.

My Lord, might I go as well?

Does house Tarly keep the old Gods?

No, My Lord.

I was named in the light of the Seven, as my father was and his father before him.

Why would you forsake the Gods of your father and your house?

The Night's Watch is my house now.

The Seven have never answered my prayers.

Perhaps the old Gods will.

As you wish, lad.

_You've all been_ _assigned an order,_ _according to our needs_ and your strengths.

Halder to the builders.

_Pyp to the stewards._

_Toad to the builders._

_Grenn to the Rangers._

_Samwell to the stewards._

Matthar to the Rangers. Dareon to the stewards.

Balian to the Rangers.

Rast to the Rangers.

_Jon to the stewards._

_Rancer to the builders._

_Echiel to the builders._

_Gordo to the stewards._

_Niko to the Rangers._

_Escan to the Rangers._

_Vorkoy to the builders._

_Joby to the stables._

_Mink to the kitchens._

_Allo to the builders._

_Nelugo to the Rangers._

May all the Gods preserve you.

Rangers with me.

_Builders!_

Samwell, you will assist me in the rookery and library.

Pyp, you will report to Bowen Marsh in the kitchens.

Luke, report to one-eyed Joe in the stables.

Dareon, we are sending you to Eastwatch.

Present yourself to Borcas when you arrive.

Make no comment about his nose.

Jon Snow, Lord Commander Mormont has requested you for his personal steward.

Will I serve the Lord Commander's meals and fetch hot water for his bath.

Certainly.

And keep a fire burning in his chambers, change his sheets and blankets daily and do everything else the Lord Commander requires of you.

Do you take me for a servant?

We took you for a man of The Night's Watch.

_But perhaps we_ _were wrong in that._

May I go?

As you wish.

Jon, wait!

Don't you see what they're doing?

I see Ser Alliser's revenge, that's all.

He wanted it and he got it.

Stewards are nothing but maids!

I'm a better swordsman and rider than any of you!

It's not fair.

_Fair?_

I was singing for a high lord at Acorn Hall when he put his hand on my leg and he wanted to see my c\*ck.

I pushed him away and he said he'd have my hands cut off for stealing their silver.

So now I'm here ... at the end of the world with no one to sing for _but old men_ _and little shits like you._

I'll never see my family again.

I'll never be inside a woman again.

So don't tell me about fair.

I thought you were caught stealing a wheel of cheese for your starving sister?

You think I was gonna tell a bunch of strangers that a high lord tried to grab my c\*ck?

Could you sing me a song, Pyp? I'd like to hear a song.

Now listen to me.

The old man is the Lord Commander of The Night's Watch.

You'll be with him day and night.

Yes, you'll clean his clothes.

But you'll also take his letters, attend him at meetings, squire for him in battle.

You'll know everything, be part of everything.

And he asked for you himself.

He wants to groom you for command.

I just...

I always wanted to be a Ranger.

I always wanted to be a Wizard.

What?

No, I'm serious.

So you'll stay and say your words with me?

Lord Stark, a moment.

Alone if you will.

He named you Protector of the Realm.

He did.

She won't care.

Give me an hour and I can put a hundred swords at your command.

And what should I do with a hundred swords?

Strike! Tonight while the castle sleeps.

We must get Joffrey away fro his mother and into our custody.

_Protector of the Realm or no,_ _he who holds the King holds the Kingdom._

_Every moment you delay gives_ _Cersei another moment to prepare._

By the time Robert dies, it will be too late for the both of us.

_What about Stannis?_

Saving the Seven Kingdoms from Cersei and delivering them to Stannis?

_You have odd notions about_ _protecting the realm._

Stannis is your older brother.

_This isn't about the bloody_ _line of succession._

That didn't matter when you rebelled against the Mad King.

It shouldn't matter now.

_What's best_ _for the Kingdoms?_

What's best for the people we rule?

We all know what Stannis is.

He inspires no love or loyalty.

He's not a King.

I am.

Stannis is a commander.

He's led men into w\*r twice.

He destroyed the Greyjoy fleet ...

Yes, he's a good soldier. Everyone knows that.

So was Robert.

Tell me something:

Do you still believe good soldiers make good kings?

I will not dishonor Robert's last hours by shedding blood in his halls and dragging frightened children from their beds.

You will sail to dragonstone tonight.

You will place this in the hand of Stannis Baratheon.

Not his steward, not his Captain of the guard, and not his wife.

Only Stannis himself.

Yes, My Lord.

Now leave us.

My Lord protector.

The King has no trueborn sons.

_Joffrey and Tommen_ are Jaime Lannister's b\*stards.

So when the King dies ...

The throne passes to his brother Lord Stannis.

So it would seem.

Unless ... there is no "unless."

He is the rightful heir. Nothing can change that.

And he cannot take the throne without your help.

You would be wise to deny it to him _and to make sure_ _Joffrey succeeds._

Do you have a shred of honor?

You are now Hand of the King _and_ Protector of the Realm.

All of the power is yours. You need only reach out and take it.

_Make peace_ _with the Lannisters._

Release the Imp. Wed your daughter to Joffrey.

_We have plenty of time_ _to get rid of Stannis._

And if Joffrey seems likely to cause problems when he comes into his throne, we simply reveal his little secret and seat Lord Renly there instead.

We?

You'll need someone to share these burdens.

I assure you ... my price would be modest.

What you suggest is treason.

Only if we lose.

Make peace with the Lannisters, you say...

With the people who tried to m\*rder my boy.

We only make peace with our enemies, My Lord.

That's why it's called "making peace."

No. I won't do it.

So it will be Stannis and w\*r?

There is no other choice.

He is the heir.

So why did you call me here?

Not for my wisdom, clearly.

You promised Catelyn you would help me.

The Queen has a dozen knights and a hundred men-at-arms ... enough to overwhelm what remains of _my_ household guard.

I need the gold cloaks.

The City Watch is 2,000 strong and sworn to defend the King's peace.

Look at you.

You know what you want me to do, you know it has to be done, but it's not honorable so the words stick in your throat.

When the Queen proclaims one King and the Hand proclaims another, whose peace do the Gold Cloaks protect?

Who do they follow?

The man who pays them.

Hear my words and bear witness to my vow.

Night gathers and now my watch begins.

_It shall not end_ _until my death._

_I shall take no wife,_ _hold no lands,_ _father no children._

_I shall wear no crowns_ _and win no glory._

I shall live and die at my post.

I am the sword in the darkness.

I am the watcher on the walls.

I am the shield that guards the realms of men.

I pledge my li and honor to The Night's Watch, for this night and all the nights to come.

You knelt as boys.

Rise now as men of The Night's Watch.

Well done. Well done.

What's he got there?

To me, ghost. Bring it here.

Gods be good!

What will they do to him?

When the Khalasar rides, he'll be leashed to a saddle, forced to run behind the horses for as long as he can.

And when he falls?

I saw a man last nine miles once.

King Robert still wants me dead.

This poisoner was the first. He won't be the last.

I thought he'd leave me alone ... now that my brother is gone.

He will never leave you alone.

_If you ride to darkest Asshai,_ _his assassins will follow you._

_If you sailed all the way_ _to the Basilisk Isles,_ _his spies would tell him._

He will never abandon the hunt.

_You're a Targaryen ..._ _the last Targaryen._

_Your son will have_ _Targaryen blood_ with 40,000 riders behind him.

He will not have my son.

He will not have you either, Khaleesi.

Lord Stark!

Stop!

Ned: No, all right.

It's all right. Let him through.

Lord Stark, King Joffrey and the Queen Regent request your presence in the Throne Room.

King Joffrey?

King Robert is gone.

The Gods give him rest.

All is accomplished. The City Watch is yours.

Good.

Is Lord Renly joining us?

I fear Lord Renly has left the city.

_He rode through_ _the old gate_ _an hour before dawn_ with Ser Loras Tyrell and some 50 retainers.

Last seen galloping South in some haste.

We stand behind you, Lord Stark.

All hail his Grace, Joffrey of Houses Baratheon and Lannister, the first of his name,

_King of the Andals_ _and the First Men,_ _Lord of the Seven Kingdoms_ and Protector of the Realm.

I command the council to make all necessary arrangements for my coronation.

I wish to be crowned within the fortnight.

Today I shall accept oaths of fealty from my loyal councilors.

Ser Barristan, I believe no man here could ever question your honor.

King Robert's seal ... unbroken.

"Lord Eddard Stark is herein named Protector of the Realm, to rule as Regent until the heir come of age."

May I see that letter, Ser Barristan?

Protector of the realm.

Is this meant to be your shield, Lord Stark?

A piece of paper?

Those were the King's words.

We have a new King now.

Lord Eddard, when we last spoke you offered me some counsel.

_Allow me to return_ _the courtesy._

Bend the knee, My Lord.

Bend the knee and swear loyalty to my son ... and we shall allow you to live out your days _in the gray waste_ _you call home._

Your son has no claim to the throne.

Liar!

You condemn yourself with your own mouth, Lord Stark.

Ser Barristan, seize this traitor.

Ser Barristan is a good man, a loyal man. Do him no harm.

You think he stands alone?

k\*ll him! k\*ll all of them, I command it!

Commander, take the Queen and her children into custody.

_Escort them back_ _to the royal apartments_ and keep them there, under guard.

Men of the Watch!

I want no bloodshed.

Tell your men to lay down their swords.

No one needs to die.

_Now!_

I did warn you not to trust me.

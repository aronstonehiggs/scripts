WOMAN \[SOFTLY\]: You must try not to worry yourself.

\[SIGHS\]  
At least we're already in a crypt.

If we were up there, we might see something everyone else is missing.

Something that makes a difference.

\- \[SCOFFS\]  
\- What?

Remember the Battle of Blackwater?

I brought us through the Mud Gate.

And got your face cut in half.

And it made a difference.

If I was out there right now...

You'd die.

There's nothing you can do.

You might be surprised at the lengths I'd go to avoid joining the Army of the Dead.

I could think of no organization less suited to my talents.

Witty remarks won't make a difference.

That's why we're down here, none of us can do anything.

It's the truth.

It's the most heroic thing we can do now...look the truth in the face.

Maybe we should have stayed married.

You were the best of them.

What a terrifying thought.

It wouldn't work between us.

Why not?

The Dragon Queen.

Your divided loyalties would become a problem.

MISSANDEI: Yes.

Without the Dragon Queen, there'd be no problem at all.

We'd all be dead already.

Bran...

I just want you to know...

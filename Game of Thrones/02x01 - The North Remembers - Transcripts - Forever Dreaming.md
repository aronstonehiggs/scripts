I would name you the Hand of the King.

_I have a son, you have a daughter,_ _we'll join our houses._

May I present Viserys of House Targaryen _and his sister_ _Daenerys?_

I give him a queen and he gives me an army.

Maester says the boy may live.

My dear brother, there are times you make me wonder whose side you're on.

You know how much I love my family.

There's great honor serving in the Night's Watch.

_The Starks have_ _manned the wall_ _for thousands of years._

_And you are a Stark._

_King Robert's b\*stards ..._ _Jon Arryn tracked them all down. Why?_

_The King has_ _no trueborn sons._

Do you love your children?

With all my heart.

No more than I love mine.

_And they're all Jaime's._

_When the King returns from_ _his hunt, I'll tell him the truth._

I want what I came for. I want the crown he promised me.

No! No!

A crown for a king.

_He was no dragon._

Fire cannot k\*ll the dragon.

_Jon Snow,_ _Lord Commander Mormont_ _has requested you_

_for his personal steward._

He wants to groom you for command.

Ned! We were hunting.

By the time Robert dies, it will be too late for the both of us.

What about Stannis? He's your older brother.

_This isn't about the bloody_ _line of succession._

He's not a king. I am.

We have a new king now.

Your son has no claim to the throne.

k\*ll him! k\*ll all of them! I command it!

You're summoned to King's Landing to swear fealty to the new king.

Joffrey puts my father in chains; Now he wants his a\*s kissed?

I'll go to King's Landing, but not alone.

_Call the Banners._

_k\*ll him, Robb._

He's more use to us alive than dead.

So long as I am your king, _treason shall never_ _go unpunished._

No! No!

Stop, my son.

You will go to King's Landing and serve as Hand of the King in my stead.

_You'll bring that boy king to heel,_ _and his mother, too, if needs be._

Please let me go home.

Mother says I'm still to marry you, so you'll stay here and obey.

My sword is yours in victory and defeat.

The King in the North! The King in the North!

What's your name?

Arry.

Arry the orphan boy.

It's 1,000 leagues from here to the Wall.

We ride out beyond the Wall tomorrow.

_The Night's Watch_ _will ride in force_ _against the wildlings,_

_the White Walkers,_ _and whatever else_ _is out there._

He will die tonight, Khaleesi.

Drogo will have no use for dragon eggs in the Night Lands.

You don't understand.

Blood of my blood.

♪ Game of Thrones 2x01 ♪ The North Remembers Original Air Date on April 1, 2012

Well struck.

Well struck, Dog.

Did you like that?

It was well struck, Your Grace.

I already said it was well struck.

Yes, Your Grace.

Who's next?

_Lothor Brune,_ freerider in the service of Lord Baelish.

Ser Dontos the Red of House Hollard.

Ser Dontos the Red of House Hollard!

_Here I am._

Here I am.

Sorry, Your Grace.

My deepest apologies.

_Are you drunk?_

No.

Uh, no. No, Your Grace.

I had two cups of wine.

Two cups?

That's not much at all.

Please, have another cup.

Are you sure, Your Grace?

_Yes. To celebrate_ _my name day._

Have two. Have as much as you like.

I would be honored, Your Grace.

Ser Meryn, help Ser Dontos celebrate my name day.

See that he drinks his fill.

You can't.

What did you say?

Did you say I can't?

I only meant it would be bad luck to k\*ll a man on your name day.

What kind of stupid peasant's superstition...

_The girl is right._

_What a man sows_ _on his name day_ he reaps all year.

Take him away.

I'll have him k\*lled tomorrow, the fool.

He is.

A fool ... you're so clever to see it.

He'll make a much better fool than a knight.

He doesn't deserve the mercy of a quick death.

Did you hear My Lady, Ser Dontos?

From this day, you'll be my new fool.

Thank you, Your Grace.

And you, My Lady, thank you.

_Beloved nephew._

We looked for you on the b\*ttlefield.

You were nowhere to be found.

I've been here, ruling the kingdoms.

What a fine job you've done.

Look at you.

More beautiful than ever.

And you! You ... you're going to be bigger than the hound, but much better looking.

This one doesn't like me.

Can't imagine why.

We heard you were dead.

I'm glad you're not dead.

Me, too, dear.

Death is so boring, especially now with so much excitement in the world.

My Lady, I'm sorry for your loss.

Her loss?

Her father was a confessed traitor.

But still her father.

Surely having so recently lost your own beloved father you can sympathize.

My father was a traitor.

My mother and brother are traitors, too.

I am loyal to my beloved Joffrey.

Of course you are.

Well, enjoy your name day, Your Grace.

Wish I could stay and celebrate, but there is work to be done.

What work?

Why are you here?

The raven arrived from the Citadel this morning, Your Grace.

The conclave has met, considered reports from Maesters all over the Seven Kingdoms, _and declared_ _this great summer_ done at last.

The longest summer in living memory.

The peasants say, a long summer means

_an even longer winter._

_A common superstition._

_We have enough wheat_ _for a five-year winter._

If it lasts any longer, we'll have fewer peasants.

The city's drowning in refugees, Your Grace, fleeing the w\*r.

We have nowhere to house them.

And with winter coming, it'll only get worse.

You command the City Watch, do you not, Lord Slynt?

_I do, Your Grace._

And are you not a Lord at my command?

I owe my title and lands to your generosity, Your Grace.

Then do your job. Shut the gates to the peasants.

They belong in the field, not our capital.

Yes, Your Grace.

Don't get up.

More ravishing than ever, big sister.

w\*r agrees with you.

Forgive the interruption. Carry on.

What are you doing here?

Ah, it's been a remarkable journey.

I pissed off the edge of the Wall,

_I slept in a sky cell,_

I fought with the hill tribes ... so many adventures, so much to be thankful for.

What are you doing here? This is the small council.

Yes. well I, do believe, the Hand of the King, is welcome at all small council meetings.

Our father is Hand of the King.

Yes, but in his absence...

_Your father has named_ _Lord Tyrion_ to serve as Hand in his stead while he fights.

Out! All of you out!

I would like to know how you tricked father into this.

If I were capable of tricking father, I'd be emperor of the world by now.

You brought this on yourself.

I've done nothing.

Quite right ... you did nothing when your son called for Ned Stark's head.

Now the entire North has risen up against us.

I tried to stop it.

Did you? You failed.

That bit of theater will haunt our family for a generation.

Robb Stark is a child.

Who's won every battle he's fought.

Do you understand we're losing the w\*r?

What do you know about warfare?

Nothing.

But I know people.

And I know that our enemies hate each other almost as much as they hate us.

Joffrey is King.

Joffrey is King.

You are here to advise him.

I'm only here to advise him.

And if the King listens to what I say, the King might just get his Uncle Jaime back.

How?

You love your children.

It's your one redeeming quality.

That and your cheekbones.

The Starks love their children as well.

And we have two of them.

One.

One?

Arya, little animal ... she disappeared.

Disappeared? What, in a puff of smoke?

We had three Starks to trade.

You chopped one's head off and let another escape.

Father will be furious.

It must be odd for you... to be the disappointing child.

_My Lord, may the Old Gods_ _watch over your brother_ _and all our northern sons._

_The walls of my Holdfast_ _will not stand the winter._

The stones were last mortared in the time of King Aerys, and I'm afraid the masons today are not fit to carry their fathers' hammers.

When I was a boy, I remember seeing them _put up a new tower_

_at Torrhen's Square in a summer._

_Men worked back then._

Today, my Holdfast looks like it was built by drunk children.

At night you can hear the wind howling through the gaps.

_And the Gods_ _forbid it rains._

Why, I might as well sleep beneath a waterfall.

_Maintenance of a Holdfast_ generally falls to the lord of that Holdfast.

Generally, yes, but I've sent all the young men off to fight Robb Stark's w\*r.

King Robb. And it's not his w\*r.

He didn't choose it.

Maybe not, My Lord, but he called in his Banners and took the men.

_Joffrey k\*lled my father,_ your liege lord.

Do you remember your vows, Ser?

Of course I remember!

We can spare four masons for a week, My Lord.

Will that be sufficient to repair your walls?

I ... I believe it will.

We didn't want him here all day, did we?

I didn't like the way he was talking about Robb.

Nor did I.

But listening to people you'd rather not listen to is one of your responsibilities as Lord of Winterfell.

_Lord Portan._

_My Lord, may the Old Gods_ _watch over your brother_ _and all our northern sons._

Boil this for an hour and drink the tea.

Makes all your pain go away.

Don't have any pain.

Lucky for you.

That way.

You've been having those dreams again.

_I don't dream._

Everyone dreams.

I don't.

Heard some of the men talking about the comet.

_They say it's an omen._

They say it means Robb will win a great victory in the South.

Did they?

I heard some other fools say it's Lannister Red.

Means the Lannisters will rule all Seven Kingdoms before long.

Heard a stableboy say it's the color of blood to mark the death of your father.

The stars don't fall for men.

The red comet means one thing, boy ... dragons.

The dragons are all dead.

They've been dead for centuries.

Mmm.

Mmm. Mmm.

What did your brother say about them, Khaleesi?

He said they ate meat.

He didn't tell you what kind of meat?

My brother didn't know anything about dragons.

He didn't know anything about anything.

Eh.

She was Drogo's first gift to me.

I remember.

I promised to protect them.

Promised them their enemies would die screaming.

How do I make starvation scream?

A trick I never learned, I'm afraid.

Does it ever end?

This is farther east than I've ever been.

But, yes, Khaleesi, everything ends, even the red waste.

And you're sure there's no other way?

If we go south to the land of the Lazarheen, the Lamb Men will k\*ll us and take your dragons.

If we go west to the Dothraki Sea, the first Khalasar we meet will k\*ll us and take your dragons.

No one will take my dragons.

They are too weak to fight, as are your people.

You must be their strength.

As you are mine.

Rakharo...

You never have.

This is bad time to start.

Having a rough time of it?

Nothing's k\*lled me yet.

Your a\*s k\*lled the sledge.

You offered me a ride.

I just wanted you to shut up about your damn blisters.

I was born in a place like this.

Later, I fell on hard times.

_Are those girls?_

_Craster's daughters._

I haven't seen a girl in six months.

I'd keep on not seeing them if I were you.

What, he don't like people messing with his daughters?

He don't like people messing with his wives.

He marries his daughters, _and they give him_ _more daughters._

And on and on it goes.

That's foul.

It's beyond foul.

All the other wildlings for a hundred leagues have disappeared.

Craster's still here.

He must be doing something right.

What happens to the boys?

Hmm?

_He marries his daughters._

What does he do with his sons?

He said he planned to stop here on his way to the Frostfangs.

People make all sorts of plans.

I haven't seen Benjen Stark in three years.

Haven't missed him.

Always treated me like scum.

Haven't had any good wine for a long time.

You Southerners make good wine, I'll give you that.

We're not Southerners.

Who's this little girl?

You're prettier than half my daughters.

You got a nice wet twat between your legs?

What's your name?

Jon Snow.

Snow, eh?

Listen to me, bastard.

All you lot from south of the Wall, you're Southerners.

But now you're in the North, the real North.

The lad meant no harm.

I catch that pretty little bastard talking to my daughters ...

No one will talk to your daughters, you have my word.

Now, sit down and shut your mouth.

You bring any of that good wine with you?

We did.

We passed through six villages on the way here.

All six were abandoned.

Where have all the wildlings gone?

I could tell you, but I'm thirsty.

_There's a barrel of_ _Dornish wine on the sledge._

_Bring it in here._

_Yes, commander._

_You want to know_ _where they've all gone?_

_North... to join up_ _with Mance Rayder..._

Your old friend.

He's no friend of mine.

He broke his vows, betrayed his brothers.

Oh, aye.

But once he was just a poor black crow.

And now he's King-Beyond-the-Wall.

He's been calling himself that for years.

What's he king of? A frozen lake somewhere?

That's a good-looking axe.

_Fresh forged?_

Give it here.

You'll have another one made at Castle Black.

Here.

Oh, that's some lovely steel.

You want to know what Mance Rayder is doing?

Gathering an army.

_What I hear,_ _he's already got more men_ _than any of your_

_southern kings._

And where does he plan marching this army?

When you're all the way north, there's only one direction to go.

These are bad times to be living alone in the wild.

The cold winds are rising.

Let them come. My roots are sunk deep.

Wife... tell the Lord Crow how content we are.

This is our place.

Our husband keeps us safe.

Better to live free than die a sl\*ve.

_Don't it make you_ _jealous, old man,_ to see me with all these young wives and you with no one to warm your bed?

We chose different paths.

Oh, aye, and you chose the path with no one but boys on it.

You'll be wanting to sleep beneath my roof, I suppose, and eat me out of pigs.

A roof would be welcome.

It's been hard riding.

We've brought our own food and good steel for you.

Any man lays a hand on one of my wives, he loses the hand.

And I see this one staring too long, I might just gouge his eyes out.

Your roof, your rules.

Who am I?!

Who am I?!

Lord commander.

And who are you?

Jon Snow.

Who _are_ you?

Your steward.

You want to lead one day?

Then learn how to follow.

_Lord of Light, come to us_ _in our darkness._

We offer you these false Gods.

Take them and cast your light upon us...

For the night is dark and full of terrors.

For the night is dark and full of terrors.

_After the long summer,_ _darkness will fall heavy_ _on the world._

The stars will bleed.

We need to stop her.

_The cold breath of winter_ _will freeze the seas..._

Not now.

_...And the dead shall rise_ _in the North._

All you men were named in the Light of the Seven!

_Is this how you treat_ _the Gods of your fathers?_

Are you so eager to spit on your ancestors?

You smell of fear ... fear and piss and old bones.

Do you want to stop me?

Stop me.

In the ancient books, it's written that a warrior will draw a burning sword from the fire.

And that sword shall be Lightbringer.

Stannis Baratheon, warrior of light, your sword awaits you.

Lord, cast your light upon us!

_For the night is dark_ _and full of terrors._

For the night is dark and full of terror.

This woman will lead him into a w\*r he cannot win.

Stannis is our king.

We follow where he leads, even if we don't like the path.

King.

Since that boar k\*lled his brother, every lord wants a coronation.

I don't serve the others. I serve Stannis.

As do I, but loyal service means telling hard truths.

He's surrounded by fools and fanatics, but he trusts you, Davos.

If you tell him the truth...

What's the truth?

_"And I declare upon_ _the honor of my house_ _that my beloved_

_brother Robert ... "_ he wasn't my beloved brother.

I didn't love him. He didn't love me.

A harmless courtesy, Your Grace.

A lie. Take it out.

"...that my brother Robert left no trueborn heirs, the boy Joffrey, the boy Tommen, and the girl Myrcella being born of incest _between Cersei Lannister and_ _her brother Jaime Lannister._

_By right of birth ... "_

Jaime Lannister, the Kingslayer.

Call him what he is.

_"...And her brother_ _Jaime Lannister,_ _the Kingslayer._

_By right of birth and blood,_ _i do this day lay claim ... "_

_Make it_ Ser _Jaime Lannister,_ _the Kingslayer._

Whatever else he is, the man's still a knight.

"Ser Jaime Lannister, the Kingslayer.

By right of birth and blood,

_I do this day lay claim_ _to the Iron Throne of Westeros._

Let all true men declare their loyalty."

When Eddard Stark learned the truth, he told only me.

I'll not make the same mistake.

Send copies of that letter to every corner of the Realm, from the Arbor to the Wall.

The time has come to choose.

Let no man claim ignorance as an excuse.

Your Grace,the Lannisters are the true enemy.

If, for the time being, you could make peace with your brother ...

I'll not make peace with Renly while he calls himself King.

Well, many have already declared for him ...

Mace Tyrell, Randyll Tarly.

Stannis does not need to beg this lord or that lord for support.

_The Lord of Light_ _stands behind him._

And how many ships has the Lord of Light got in his fleet?

He has no need for ships.

I'm sure he doesn't, but we do if we're going to w\*r.

If not Renly, Your Grace, join forces with Robb Stark.

Who would steal the northern half of my kingdom.

I've always served thieves according to their desserts, _as you well know,_

_Ser Davos._

Joffrey, Renly, Robb Stark, they're all thieves.

They'll bend the knee or I'll destroy them.

I owe you an apology, my King.

My duty is to serve.

_You have chosen the new God_ _over the Old Gods._

_May the Lord of Light_ _watch over us all._

Shall we drink together?

Don't.

A cup of wine to honor the one true God.

The night is dark and full of terrors, old man, but the fire burns them all away.

Your Grace.

King in the North.

I keep expecting you to leave me in one castle or another for safekeeping, but you drag me along from camp to camp.

Have you grown fond of me, Stark?

Is that it?

I've never seen you with a girl.

If I left you with one of my bannermen, your father would know within a fortnight and my bannerman would receive a raven with a message:

"Release my son and you'll be rich beyond your dreams.

Refuse and your house will be destroyed, root and stem."

You don't trust the loyalty of the men following you into battle?

Oh, I trust them with my life, just not with yours.

Smart boy.

What's wrong?

_Don't like_ _being called "boy"?_

Insulted?

_You insult yourself,_ _Kingslayer._

_You've been defeated by a boy._

_You're held c\*ptive_ _by a boy._

_Perhaps you'll be_ _k\*lled by a boy._

Stannis Baratheon sent ravens to all the high lords of Westeros.

King Joffrey Baratheon is neither a true king _nor a true Baratheon._

He's your bastard son.

_If that's true,_ _Stannis is the rightful king._

How convenient for him.

My father learned the truth.

That's why you had him ex\*cuted.

I was your prisoner when Ned Stark lost his head.

Your son k\*lled him so the world wouldn't learn who fathered him.

And you ... you pushed my brother from a window because he saw you with the queen.

You have proof?

Or do you want to trade gossip like a couple of fishwives?

I'm sending one of your cousins down to King's Landing with my peace terms.

You think my father's going to negotiate with you?

You don't know him very well.

No, but he's starting to know me.

_Three victories_ _don't make you a conqueror._

It's better than three defeats.

_This city stinks..._

Like dead bodies.

_A bit corpsey, yes._

And sh\*t.

I thought you wanted to come here.

I love it.

You love the smell of dead bodies and sh\*t?

And cum and garlic and rum.

You can smell cum from the balcony?

I love the stink. I love the noise.

Cities make me want to f\*ck.

And so did the country.

This is where I belong.

Yes, well, you need to be careful.

No one can know you're here.

No one will know.

You can't trust anyone in King's Landing.

_They're all liars ..._ _good liars, bad liars,_ one or two great liars.

What about you?

Me? I'm not from here. I'm a sl\*ve to the truth.

Truth?

You are the biggest little liar I have ever met.

Why do you think I am so little?

I'm being crushed beneath the weight of all that truth.

Oh!

Ned Stark actually slept on this.

As if the poor man didn't suffer enough.

One of the many changes we'll have to make around here.

Lord Baelish.

Your Grace.

I wonder if I might ask you for a favor.

Of course, Your Grace.

Ned Stark's youngest daughter Arya ... we can't seem to locate her.

If she's escaped the capital, Winterfell seems the logical destination.

And yet my friends in the North report no sign of her.

Curious.

If we choose to negotiate with the Starks, the girl has some value. Whoever finds her ... well, you know what they say about Lannisters and debts.

Well, you could ask Varys where she is.

He'll have an answer for you.

Whether you believe it...

Myself, I have always had a hard time trusting eunuchs.

Who knows what they want?

A mockingbird.

You created your own Sigil, didn't you?

Yes.

Appropriate... for a self-made man with so many songs to sing.

I'm glad you like it.

Some people are fortunate enough to be born into the right family.

Others have to find their own way.

I heard a song once about a boy of modest means who found his way into the home of a very prominent family.

He loved the eldest daughter.

Sadly, she had eyes for another.

When boys and girls live in the same home, awkward situations can arise.

Sometimes, I've heard, even brothers and sisters develop certain affections.

And when these affections become common knowledge, well, that is an awkward situation indeed, especially in a prominent family.

But prominent families often forget a simple truth, I've found.

And which truth is that?

Knowledge is power.

Seize him.

Cut his throat.

Stop. Wait.

I've changed my mind. Let him go.

Step back three paces.

Turn around.

Close your eyes.

Power is power.

Do see if you can take some time away from your coins and your whores to locate the Stark girl for me.

I would very much appreciate it.

_You're Ser Alton Lannister?_

I am, Your Grace.

_I offer your cousins peace_ _if they meet my terms._

First, your family must release my sisters.

Second, my father's bones must be returned to us so he may rest beside his brother and sister in the crypts beneath Winterfell.

And the remains of all those who died in his service must also be returned.

Their families can honor them with proper funerals.

An honorable request, Your Grace.

_Third..._

Joffrey and the Queen Regent must renounce all claim to dominion of the North.

From this time till the end of time, we are a free and independent kingdom.

The King in the North.

King in the North.

Neither Joffrey nor any of his men shall set foot in our lands again.

If he disregards this command, he shall suffer the same fate as my father, only I don't need a servant to do my beheading for me.

These are ... Your Grace, these are ... these are my terms.

If the Queen Regent and her son meet them, I'll give them peace.

If not...

I will litter the south with Lannister dead.

King Joffrey is a Baratheon, Your Grace.

Oh, is he?

You'll ride at daybreak, Ser Alton.

That will be all for tonight.

A word, Your Grace?

You don't have to call me "Your Grace" when no one's around.

It's not so bad once you get used to it.

I'm glad someone's gotten used to it.

The Lannisters are going to reject your terms, you know?

Of course they are.

We can fight them in the fields as long as you like, but we won't beat them until you take King's Landing.

And we can't take King's Landing without ships.

My father has ships and men who know how to sail them.

Men who fought my father.

Men who fought King Robert to free themselves from the yoke of the South, just like you're doing now.

I'm his only living son.

He'll listen to me. I know he will.

I'm not a Stark. I know that.

But your father raised me to be an honorable man.

We can avenge him together.

You don't want Balon Greyjoy for an ally.

I need his ships. They say he has 200.

They say a million rats live in the sewers of King's Landing.

Shall we rally them to fight for us?

I understand you don't trust Lord Greyjoy.

I don't trust Lord Greyjoy because he is not trustworthy.

Your father had to go to w\*r to end his rebellion.

Yes. And now I'm the one rebelling against the throne.

Before me, it was father.

You married one rebel and mothered another.

I mothered more than just rebels, a fact you seem to have forgotten.

If I trade the Kingslayer for two girls, my bannermen will string me up by my feet.

You want to leave Sansa in the Queen's hands?

_And Arya ..._

I haven't heard a word about Arya.

What are we fighting for if not for them?

It's more complicated than that!

You know it is.

It's time for me to go home.

I haven't seen Bran or Rickon in months.

You can't go to Winterfell.

I beg your pardon?

I'll send Rodrik to watch over the boys because tomorrow you'll ride south to the Stormlands.

Why in the name of all the Gods ... because I need you to negotiate with Renly Baratheon.

He's rallied an army of 100,000.

You know him. You know his family.

I haven't seen Renly Baratheon since he was a boy.

_You have a hundred_ _other lords ..._

Which of these lords do I trust more than you?

If Renly sides with us, we'll outnumber them two to one.

When they feel the jaws beginning to shut, they'll sue for peace.

We'll get the girls back.

Then we'll all go home... for good.

I will ride at first light.

We will all be together again soon, I promise.

You've done so well.

Your father would be... proud.

Give Lord Renly my regards.

_King_ Renly.

There's a king in every corner now.

What is all this?

Returning this room to its proper appearance.

Say what you will about the Targaryens ... they were conquerors.

That is a seat for a conqueror.

It needs a room to match it, not vines and flowers.

We can't find Arya Stark.

With luck, she's dead in a ditch somewhere.

Perhaps. But if not, we need her.

They'll never give Jaime back to us for Sansa alone.

I think they might. They're weak.

They put too much value on their women.

We need to set our armies to the task of finding her.

Send out as many men as we can.

I'm sure if you asked grandfather ...

The King does not ask; He commands.

And my grandfather's stupidity in the field of battle is the reason Robb Stark has Uncle Jaime in the first place.

His life is in danger.

We're at w\*r.

All our lives are in danger.

I heard a disgusting lie about Uncle Jaime.

And you.

Our enemies will say anything to weaken your claim to the throne.

It's not a claim. The throne is mine.

Of course it is.

No one believes this foul gossip.

Someone believes it.

Father had other children?

Besides me and Tommen and Myrcella?

What are you asking?

I'm asking if he f\*cked other women when he grew tired of you.

How many b\*stards does he have running ...

What you just did is punishable by death.

You will never do it again.

Never.

That will be all, Mother.

No, no, no, no.

Do you have any idea how ridiculous you sound?

Ease into it.

Slowly, with passion.

Oh, yeah.

Go wash yourselves. Put some clothes on.

Both of you are working tonight.

We do things differently here, Daisy.

This isn't some five-copper bawdy house in Hayseed Hall.

Haystack Hall.

Wherever you're from.

Our establishment doesn't cater to ploughmen and goat herders.

Lord Olsen.

Taste is everything here.

Littlefinger's a fancy man.

Don't call him Littlefinger.

He doesn't like it.

_Lord Baelish._

She pretends she doesn't speak the common tongue so that people will think she's exotic.

She grew up just down the road in flea bottom.

She's beautiful.

She's a dumb sl\*t, really, but a lid for every pot.

Lord Commander.

Good to see you... Again.

You do realize this establishment is owned by Lord Petyr Baelish, the King's Master of Coin...

Coin which goes in many pockets.

Orders.

Whose orders?

Someone who doesn't care what Littlefinger thinks.

No, you can't. No! Please!

No! Not my Barra!

Please. Please.

Enough. Get it done.

_k\*ll the bastard._

_No, no!_

_Please._

Give it here.

No, please.

_Spread out._ _Search every house._

_Every room._ _Look in every room._

People shouting )

Gendry! His name is Gendry.

Where is the bastard?

The Night's Watch! Please, stop!

Where?

They took him up the Kingsroad, heading north.

How will we know him?

_He's got a bull's head helmet._

_He made it himself._

Find him.

The substance burns so hot, it melts wood, stone, even steel.

_And, of course, flesh._

If I could tell you how many crazy old men I've seen making grand claims about jars full of pig sh\*t.

Our order does not deal in pig sh\*t.

King Stannis is my God. He raised me up and gave you a future I could never have imagined.

And you think a Fire God commanded all that?

It was Stannis.

Stannis is my king, but he's only a man.

Don't tell him that.

Does it give you joy to scare people?

No, it gives me joy to k\*ll people.

k\*lling's the sweetest thing there is.

You shipped off my only daughter and now you want to send my eldest son to the b\*ttlefield to die.

He needs to be out there.

The men will fight more fiercely seeing their king fighting beside them instead of hiding behind his mother's skirts.

Stannis two days from the capital and the wolf at my doorstep.

Scouts assure us Robb Stark won't risk marching on Casterly Rock until he's at full force.

He'll risk anything at any time.

_We'll ride at nightfall._

The Stark forces are distracted. Now is the time to strike.

My dear nephew, you do understand Stannis Baratheon sails this way?

They say Stannis never smiles. I'll give him a red smile.

If the wind holds, we'll reach King's Landing in a day.

Will it hold?

Can't make promises for the wind, Your Grace.

Stannis knows King's Landing.

He knows where the walls are strongest and he knows which gates are weakest.

Mud gate. That's where he'll land.

And if Stannis does attack the mud gate, what do we have?

_( Theme music playing )_

♪ Game of Thrones 2x09 ♪ Blackwater Original Air Date on May 27, 2012 ♪

Man: _That's it._

_( Men coughing )_

_( Thunder rumbling )_

The tide's against us.

Aye, but we have the wind.

She'll blow us straight to the gate.

You're coming home.

King's Landing hasn't been home for 20 years.

I spent most of my life dodging the Royal Fleet.

And now I'm sailing right at them.

This is the Royal Fleet.

And you're not a smuggler anymore, you're the high captain.

Of course there are several Royal Fleets at the moment.

Not after tonight. When the sun rises, Stannis will sit on the Iron Throne and you will be his Hand.

Gods be good.

God.

Father, there is only one and he watches over us.

But not over them?

Over all of us.

The people of King's Landing did not choose the false King Joffrey Baratheon.

They will be glad to see his head on a spike.

Well, first we have to put it there.

Our ships outnumber theirs 10 to one.

Our army outnumber theirs five to one.

Those walls have never been breached.

And the men guarding the walls, when they see you, they don't see a liberator.

They see a stranger come to set their city on fire.

I have faith in the Lord of Light.

I have faith in our cause.

And I have faith in my captain.

_( Thunder crashes )_

Are you afraid, my lion?

If the city falls, Stannis will burn every Lannister he can find.

Of course I'm afraid.

I won't let them hurt you.

I'm a Lannister.

I don't have a choice in all this.

But it's not your w\*r.

It is now.

You can't f\*ck your way out of everything.

I have so far.

Do you remember what you said when you met me in your tent?

That I should make love to you like it was your last day on this earth.

Pycelle: _As you know, Your Grace,_ it is not only the sworn duty of a Maester to carry out the wishes of the house he serves, but also to offer guidance and counsel in times of w\*r.

Your words are always wise and measured.

If you could ...

If anything, a Maester's duties become more urgent in times of w\*r and turmoil.

I remember back in the days of king ...

You brought me something?

Yes.

Essence of Nightshade is as dangerous as it is efficacious.

A single drop in a cup of wine suffices to soothe ragged nerves.

_Three drops_ _will bring on a deep_ _and dreamless sleep._

_10 drops, however ..._

I know what 10 drops will bring.

Your Grace, if I may ask ...

You may not.

You must have a lot of work to do.

I'm sure many brave men will need your wisdom soon.

Yes. A siege is very ...

Be careful on the stairs, Grand Maester. There are so many.

( Sighs ) Your Grace.

Drunk Lannisters.

( Men laugh )

You've got a pretty voice.

Thank you very much.

And I like your nose.

How many times you break it?

Well, now let's see.

_First time I was five._

Me mom smacked me with an iron poker.

Ooh.

Oh, it wasn't me she was aiming at.

She was trying for me little brother.

Now he was a real pest.

Second time I was nine.

Got in a scrap with a few older boys.

They won.

Third time...

Eh, you don't want to know about the third time.

Poor nose.

Don't feel sorry for him.

He'll be halfway up your a\*s before the night's through.

( Men laugh )

( Chatter stops )

Welcome, friends.

This round's on me.

I don't think he likes me.

You think you're a hard man?

( Chuckles, slaps )

I know it.

( Men laugh )

It's warm in here.

We've got beautiful women and good brown ale.

Plenty for everyone.

And all you want is to put one of us in the cold ground with no women to keep us company.

Oh, there's women in the ground.

I put some there myself.

So have you.

You like f\*cking and drinking and singing.

But k\*lling ... k\*lling's the thing you love.

You're just like me.

Only smaller.

And quicker.

Eh?

( Chuckles )

Your Lord Imp is gonna miss you.

Aye.

( Slaps )

I expect he will someday.

_( Bell tolling )_

Man: _Here we are._

( Chatter )

One more drink before the w\*r?

Shall we?

I've always hated the bells.

They ring for horror ... a dead king, a city under siege.

A wedding.

Exactly.

Podrick, is that it?

"Is that it?" Nice touch.

As if you don't know the name of every boy in town.

I'm not entirely sure what you're suggesting.

I'm entirely sure you're entirely sure what I'm suggesting.

Do you trust him?

Oddly enough, I do.

Good.

The map you asked for.

There must be 20 miles of tunnels beneath the city.

Closer to 50.

_The Targaryens built this_ _city to withstand a siege_ and to provide escape if necessary.

I'm not escaping.

Strange as it sounds, I'm the captain of the ship.

And if the ship goes down, I go with her.

That is good to hear.

Though I'm sure many captains say the same while their ship is afloat.

You look well suited for battle, My Lord.

Well, I'm not.

For all our sakes, I hope you are wrong.

My little birds tell me that Stannis Baratheon has taken up with a Red Priestess from Asshai.

What of it?

You don't believe in the old powers, My Lord?

Blood spells, curses, shape-shifting ... what do you think?

I think you believe in what you see and in what those you trust have seen.

You probably don't entirely trust me.

Mm, don't take it personally.

I don't entirely trust myself.

And yet I have seen things _and heard things ..._ things you have not, things I wish I had not.

I don't believe I've ever told you how I was cut.

No, I don't believe you have.

One day I will.

The dark arts have provided Lord Stannis with his armies and paved his path to our door.

For a man in service to such powers to sit on the Iron Throne, I can think of nothing worse.

And tonight, I believe you are the only man who can stop him.

( Tolling continues )

They're welcoming the new king.

I've never known bells to mean surrender.

They want to play music with us? Let's play.

Drums.

Drums!

( Men shouting )

( Men shouting )

Tyrion: _Remember, wait till the sh\*t ..._

Bronn: _The ships are in the bay._

They must be far enough in so they won't be ...

I know what "in" means.

Do you know how to use that?

I chopped wood once.

No, I watched my brother chopping wood.

I saw you k\*ll a man with a shield.

You'll be unstoppable with an axe.

Don't get k\*lled.

Nor you, my friend.

Oh, are we friends now?

Of course we are.

Just because I pay you for your services doesn't diminish our friendship.

Enhances it, really.

Oh, enhances. Fancy word for a sellsword.

Been spending time with fancy folks.

Lady Sansa and, uh, Sheila.

Shae.

Shae, yes.

Surely my sister has asked you to join the other highborn ladies in Maegor's holdfast.

She has, My Lord, but King Joffrey sent for me to see him off.

Sansa.

He's been a great romantic, my nephew.

Joffrey: _Sansa, come here._

I will pray for your safe return, My Lord.

Will you?

Just as I pray for the King's.

Stay safe, My Lady.

And you, my lion.

Your king rides forth to battle.

You should see him off with a kiss.

My new blade.

Hearteater I've named it.

Kiss it.

You'll kiss it again when I return and taste my Uncle's blood.

Will you slay him yourself?

If Stannis is fool enough to come near me.

So you'll be outside the gates fighting in the Vanguard?

A king doesn't discuss battle plans with stupid girls.

I'm sorry, Your Grace. You're right, I'm stupid.

Of course you'll be in the Vanguard.

They say my brother Robb always goes where the fighting is thickest.

And he is only a pretender.

Your brother's turn will come.

Then you can lick his blood off Hearteater, too.

Some of those boys will never come back.

Joffrey will.

The worst ones always live.

Shh. Come, My Lady.

( Men shouting )

( Neighing )

( Men shouting )

_( Distant drums beating )_

_( Distant drums beating )_

Where's our fleet?

On the way.

Why isn't it here now? They're coming.

Hound, tell the Hand that his King has asked him a question.

The King has asked you a question.

Ser Lancel, tell the Hound to tell the king that the Hand is extremely busy.

The Hand of the King would like me to tell you to tell the King ...

If I tell the Hound to cut you in half, he'll do it without a second thought.

That would make me the Quarterman.

It just doesn't have the same ring to it.

Cut me in half and I won't be able to give the signal.

_No signal, no plan._

No plan and Stannis Baratheon sacks this city, takes the Iron Throne, puts your pinched little head atop a gate somewhere.

It might be quite amusing, except that my head would be up there, too.

I've never much liked my head, but I don't want to see it removed just yet.

_( Drums beating )_

Where are their ships?

It is wise to attack at night. We took them by surprise.

Lord Varys knows what you had for breakfast three days ago.

There are no surprises here.

If it's true there is dissension in their ranks, maybe their sailors have mutinied.

Maybe.

_( Babies crying )_

I don't know why she wants me here.

She's always saying how stupid I am. She hates me.

Maybe she hates you less than she hates everyone else.

I doubt it.

Maybe she's jealous of you.

Why would she be jealous?

Sansa.

I was wondering where our little dove had flown.

You look pale, child.

Is your red flower still blooming?

Yes.

Fitting, isn't it?

The men will bleed out there and you will bleed in here.

Pour Lady Sansa some wine.

I'm not thirsty, Your Grace.

So? I didn't offer you water.

What's he doing here?

Ser Ilyn?

_He's here to defend us._

When the axes smash down those doors, you may be glad to have him.

But we have guards to defend us.

Guards we have paid.

Should the city fall, they'll be the first ones out of the doors.

The lads caught a groom and two maids trying to sneak away _with a stolen horse_ _and some gold cups._

The battle's first traitors.

Have Ser Ilyn see to them.

Put their heads on spikes outside the stables as a warning.

The only way to keep the small folk loyal is to make certain they fear you more than they do the enemy.

Remember that if you ever hope to become a queen.

_( Door closes )_

You said he was here to protect us.

He is.

Traitors are a danger to us all.

More wine.

_( Distant drums beating )_

( Men shouting )

There they are.

Archers to their marks.

Archers, to your marks!

Man: _Archers!_

Nock your arrows!

Man: _Nock arrows!_

Hold fast.

Man: _Hold fast!_

What are you doing? We need to attack them.

Hold fast.

Man: _Boulders ready!_

Man #2: _Hold fast!_

There's only one ship. Where are the rest of them?

Where are the rest of them?!

There's only one ship.

Archers, stand to!

_Man the below!_

Nock!

Man: _Nock and set!_

Draw!

Hold.

Man: _Hold!_

There's no one on board.

Man: _More rocks coming up!_

Man: _Hold._

Wildfire.

Steer clear! Steer clear!

Matthos! Get down!

( Men screaming )

( Laughs )

( Men wailing )

( Men wailing, shouting )

Prepare to land.

Your Grace...

The dwarf has played his little trick.

The wildfire ...

He can only play it once.

We're too far from the gates.

The fire, their archers ... hundreds will die.

Thousands.

Come with me and take this city!

( Cheering )

Sansa, come here, little dove.

My queen.

What are you doing?

Praying.

You're perfect, aren't you?

Praying.

_What are you praying for?_

For the Gods to have mercy on us all.

Oh. On all of us?

Yes, Your Grace.

Even me?

Of course, Your Grace.

Even Joffrey?

Joffrey is my ...

Oh, shut up, you little fool.

Praying to the Gods to have mercy on us all.

The Gods have no mercy. That's why they're Gods.

_My father told me that_ _when he caught me praying._

My mother just died, you see.

I didn't really understand the concept of death, the finality of it.

I thought that if I prayed very, very hard, the Gods would return my mother to me. I was four.

Your father doesn't believe in the Gods?

He believes in them, he just doesn't like them very much.

One for her.

Here.

Sit.

Drink.

Not like that. Drink, girl.

I should have been born a man.

I'd rather face 1,000 swords than be shut up inside with this flock of frightened hens.

They are your guests under your protection.

You asked them here.

It was expected of me, as it will be of you if you ever become Joffrey's queen.

If my wretched brother should somehow prevail, these hens will return to their cocks and crow of how my courage inspired them, lifted their spirits.

And if the city should fall?

You'd like that, wouldn't you?

The Red Keep should hold for a time, long enough for me to go to the walls and yield to Lord Stannis in person.

If it were anyone else outside those gates, I might have hoped for a private audience.

But this is Stannis Baratheon.

I'd have a better chance of seducing his horse.

Have I shocked you, little dove?

Tears aren't a woman's only w\*apon.

The best one's between your legs.

Learn how to use it. Drink.

Do you have any notion of what happens when a city is sacked?

No, you wouldn't, would you?

If the city falls, these fine women should be in for a bit of a r\*pe.

_Half of them_ _will have b\*stards_ in their bellies come the morning.

You'll be glad of your red flower then.

When a man's blood is up, anything with tits looks good.

A precious thing like you will look very, very good.

A slice of cake just waiting to be eaten.

More pressure!

( Men shouting, grunting )

Pull! Pull!

That's it, men!

_Pull! Pull!_

_That's it!_

_Steady!_

He's a serious man ... Stannis Baratheon.

They're coming. They're coming ashore.

Rain fire on them.

Archers!

There are too many.

Hound, form a welcome party for any Baratheon troop that manages to touch solid ground.

Pod, run to the King's gate.

Bring any men guarding it here now.

Yes, My Lord.

Let's go. Stannis is sending us fresh meat.

You, too.

Any of these flaming f\*cking arrows come near me, I'll strangle you with your own guts.

( Men shouting )

Pull, pull! Go!

Nock!

_Draw!_

_Draw!_

Draw!

( Men shouting )

Man:

_k\*ll the Lannisters!_

Loose!

Loose!

Man: Form the line!

Stannis!

Draw!

_Draw!_

Loose!

_Loose!_

Man: _They cannot_ _breach the wall!_

Yah!

The mud gate, go now!

First and second squads, to the gate! To the mud gate!

Hound: Any man dies with a clean sword, I'll r\*pe his f\*cking corpse.

( Screams )

Cersei: _When we were young,_ _Jaime and I,_ _we looked so much alike._

_Even our father_ _couldn't tell us apart._

_I could never understand why_ _they treated us differently._

Jaime was taught to fight with sword and lance and mace, and I was taught to smile _and sing and please._

He was heir to Casterly Rock and I was sold to some stranger like a horse to be ridden whenever he desired.

You were Robert's queen.

And you will be Joffrey's. Enjoy.

I don't think I know this one.

Pretty.

That's the worst curtsy I've ever seen.

Here, it's not difficult. I mastered it when I was four.

Straighten your back and bend.

Better. You learn fast.

How long have you been in Lady Sansa's service?

A few weeks, Your Grace.

When did you leave Lorath?

I had a Lorathi handmaiden once.

But she was a nobleman's daughter.

You're not.

When did you come to Westeros?

10 years ago, Your Grace.

From Lorathi commoner to the Red Keep in 10 years, all without learning how to curtsy.

I imagine that's a very interesting story.

What's your name?

Shae, Your Grace.

Tell us a story, Shae.

When I was 13, I ...

_( Door opens )_

Your Grace!

What news?

The Imp has set the river afire.

Hundreds of ships are burning, maybe more.

Stannis's fleet destroyed, but...

( Quietly ) But ... but his troops have landed outside the city walls.

Where is Joffrey?

On the battlements with Lord Tyrion.

Bring him back inside at once.

But, Your Grace ...

What?

The King's presence is good for morale.

Bring him back to his chambers now.

Not here?

With the women and children?

Do you want him to be mocked as a coward for the rest of his life?

No, but I ...

Now!

When I told you about Ser Ilyn earlier, I lied.

Do you want to hear the truth?

You want to know why he's really here?

He's here for us.

Stannis may take the city, he may take the throne, but he will not take us alive.

( Screaming )

( Arrow thunks )

Man: _Ah! Help me!_

_( Man #2 shouting )_

Man: We'd better run!

Men: Fall back!

Get the ladders up!

( Grunts )

Faster, you b\*stards! Faster!

Come on, k\*ll the scum!

Someone bring me a drink.

f\*ck the water. Bring me wine.

Can I get you some iced milk and a nice bowl of raspberries, too?

Eat sh\*t, dwarf.

You're on the wrong side of the wall.

I lost half my men.

The Blackwater's on fire.

Dog, I command you to go back out there and fight.

You're Kingsguard, Clegane.

You must beat them back or they're going to take this city ... your king's city.

( Sniffles ) f\*ck the Kingsguard.

f\*ck the city.

f\*ck the King.

( Men shouting )

Man: Loose!

Man #2: Put your backs into it!

All right, get up!

Man: Loose!

Man #2: _Clear!_

Forward!

( Men shouting )

Loose!

Forward ladders!

Man: _They're coming_ _up the wall!_

_Archers on the north wall!_

Man #2: _Heave!_

_( Men grunting )_

Man #2: _Heave!_

_( Men grunting )_

Your Grace, _the queen has sent me to bring_ _you back to the Red Keep._

If you won't defend your own city, why should they?

What would you have me do?

Lead.

_Get down there_ _and lead your people_ against the invaders who want to k\*ll them.

What did my mother say exactly?

Did she have urgent business with me?

She did not say, Your Grace.

Man: _All men to the battlements!_

Ser Boros, Ser Mandon, stay with my Uncle and represent the king on the field of battle.

Man: _Archers, hold your line_ _or I'll k\*ll you myself._

Man: _Stand fast!_

No!

Get up, you fool.

Man: _We need more arrows!_

Man: _Where is the king?_

_Why isn't he with us?_

Man #2: _Who are we fighting for?_

Man #3: _Who leads us?_

( Softly ) I'll lead the attack.

I'll lead the attack!

Man: Yes?

Man #2: _What are you talking about?_

Pod, my helmet.

Ser Mandon, you will bear the King's banner.

Men, form up.

_Men ..._

_men!_

Come on.

They say I'm half a man.

But what does that make the lot of you?

The only way out is through the gates.

And they're at the gates.

There's another way out. I'm going to show you.

We'll come out behind them and f\*ck them in their asses.

_( Men laugh )_

_( Pounding )_

_( Men grunting )_

Man: _Heave!_

_Heave!_

Don't fight for your king and don't fight for his kingdoms.

_Don't fight for honor._

_Don't fight for glory._

Don't fight for riches, because you won't get any.

This is your city Stannis means to sack.

That's your gate he's ramming.

_If he gets in, it will be_ _your houses he burns,_ your gold he steals, your women he will r\*pe.

Heave! Heave!

( Men grunting )

_Heave! Heave!_

_( Men grunting )_

Those are brave me knocking at our door.

Let's go k\*ll them.

( Cheering )

The battle is lost, Your Grace.

Stannis's troops are at the gates.

When the Gold Cloaks saw the king leaving, they lost all heart.

Where is my son?

I want to escort him back to the battle.

Why do I care what you want?

Bring me ...

Now listen to me ... ah!

( Groaning )

Don't be afraid. The queen has raised the drawbridge.

This is the safest place we can be.

Joffrey's not hurt. He's fighting bravely.

_His knights have_ _rallied behind him._

_They will save the city._

Shall we sing a hymn?

_♪ Gentle mother ♪_

♪ font of mercy ♪  
♪ save our sons from w\*r, we pray ♪  
♪ gentle ... ♪ ( Gasps )

You must go.

Run to your chamber and bar your door.

Stannis won't hurt you. This one will.

Come with me.

I need to say goodbye to someone.

The queen said they'd r\*pe everyone.

No one is raping me.

Go. Run.

Women: _♪ save our sons_ _from w\*r, we pray. ♪_

_( Combatant screams )_

The lady is starting to panic.

( Gasps )

What are you doing here?

_Not here for long._

I'm going.

Where?

Someplace that isn't burning.

North, might be.

Could be.

What about the king?

He can die just fine on his own.

I can take you with me.

Take you to Winterfell.

I'll keep you safe.

Do you want to go home?

I'll be safe here.

Stannis won't hurt me.

Look at me.

Stannis is a k\*ller.

The Lannisters are K\*llers.

Your father was a k\*ller.

Your brother is a k\*ller.

Your sons will be K\*llers someday.

The world is built by K\*llers.

So you'd better get used to looking at them.

You won't hurt me.

No, little bird, I won't hurt you.

( Men grunting )

Heave! Heave!

Come on, you b\*stards! Get up those ladders!

Ah!

Attack!

Roll it over!

( Men cheering )

( Chanting ) Halfman! Halfman! Halfman! Halfman!

Halfman! Halfman! Halfman! Halfman!

( Chanting continues )

Oh, f\*ck me.

( Shouting )

Shh.

Be calm, my sweet.

They're still fighting.

No one's going to hurt you.

_I'll tell you a story._

You know the one about the mother lion and her little cub?

They lived in the woods.

The Kingswood.

Yes, my love.

In the Kingswood there lived a mother and her cub.

She loved him very much.

But there were other things that lived in the woods.

Evil things.

Like what?

Like stags.

Stags aren't evil.

They only eat grass.

And wolves.

My Lord.

Cersei: _He could hear them_ _howling in the night._

_The little cub_ _was frightened._

_His mother said,_ _"You are a lion, my son._

_You mustn't be afraid._

For one day all the beasts will bow to you.

You will be king.

_All the stags will bow._Ts _all the wolves will bow._

The bears in the north and the foxes of the south,

_all the birds in the sky_

_and the beasts in the sea ..._ they will all come to you, little lion... to rest a crown upon your head."

And the cub said, "Will I be strong and fierce like my father?"

"Yes," said his mother.

"You will be strong and fierce just like your father."

I will keep you safe, my love.

I promise you.

_( Doors open )_

( Men shouting )

Man: Back to the boats!

Stand and fight!

_Stand and fight,_ _damn you!_

No!

Father.

The battle is over. We have won.
